# üê¶ Flappy-ML agents in Unity
![Flappy](flappy.gif)
## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a reinforcement learning agent to play the Flappy Bird game using Unity. The agent learns to navigate between pipes by receiving rewards based on its performance, predominantly focusing on survival time and successful pipe passing. The implementation utilizes Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or other preferred algorithms from popular reinforcement learning libraries.

## Requirements

- Unity (version compatible with the project)
- Python 3.x
- ML-Agents Toolkit (Unity ML-Agents)
